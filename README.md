# Digital-Blocks-in-Verilog
Digital blocks archive by using open source tool: Icarus Verilog &amp; GTKWave

# iverilog tutorial
The directory is shared by Albert Xie: https://github.com/albertxie/iverilog-tutorial. 
It provides a good user guide to run the iverilog at the first. I am highly recommend everyone to use the open source tools for digital design.
